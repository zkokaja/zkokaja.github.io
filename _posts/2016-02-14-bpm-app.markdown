I recently read an
[article](https://blog.cardiogr.am/2016/02/12/do-you-really-need-10000-steps-a-day-2/)
about the origins of the "10,000 steps a day" idea. Why 10,000? It also examined
how the number of steps you take correlate with overall health; the idea being
to see if there's a correlation between number of steps and a lower *resting
heart rate*.
<br style='clear:both;' />

As someone without an Apple Watch or a similar device, I don't have a way to
automatically add data to the phone's Health app to track my resting heart rate.
So I decided to create an app that allows me to do just that.

The idea is that the user would have the phone in one hand and the other hand
measuring their pulse via the radial or carotid artery (see
[here](http://www.webmd.com/heart/taking-a-pulse-heart-rate). With each pulse,
the user taps on the phone. After a set numbers of pulses, the app displays the
heart rate to the user and allows them to add it to the Health App.

And in less than a day's work, I built this simple app! Let me show you
screen-shots first: 

1) The launch screen where you start tapping your pulse

     class="center-image" width="350px" />

2) After 15 beats, you get the options to add or try again

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/2016-02-14-bpm-app-2.png" alt="Add screen"
     class="center-image" width="350px" />

3) And just for fun, here's the verification:

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/2016-02-14-bpm-app-3.png" alt="Health screen"
     class="center-image" width="350px" />

I've written iOS apps before, but never in Swift (which is a fun language) and
this is the first time I integrated with HealthKit. This is meant to be a
stepping stone to move onto larger app projects I've been meaning to do - more
utilities to make my life easier and hopefully others as well!

I've read that the best time to measure resting heart rate is in the morning
after you wake up. So now I have an easy way to do it without the laborious
method of manually counting pulses in a specific interval, multiplying, and then
manually adding that data point to Health.

I will be uploading the source code to my GitHub account very soon.
