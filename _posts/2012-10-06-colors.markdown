I've been playing around with the Unix tool 'awk' for a week or two now, and
it's been fun. I recommend everyone to learn it because it is an incredibly
powerful tool. For an example, I'm going to show a simple program I wrote with
it that searches for three color words ("red", "green", and "blue") in
whatever file you give it; and it will show you how many instances there were,
and where they were.

So, here's the code:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash
awk '
   BEGIN { printf "33[30m" }
   {
       if ($0 ~ / red /)
       {
            redSum++;
            printf "33[41m"
            print;
            printf "33[47m"
       }
       else if ($0 ~ / blue /)
       {
            blueSum++;
            printf "33[44m"
            print;
            printf "33[47m"
       }
       else if ($0 ~ / green /)
       {
            greenSum++;
            printf "33[42m"
            print;
            printf "33[47m"
       }
    }

    END { printf "33[47m"; printf "\nThere were %s reds, %s blues, %s greens\n", redSum, blueSum, greenSum; }
' $1
{% endhighlight %}

And here's what it looks like:
